1) load data
	load capout.sashdat and put in-memory (keep track of the location)
	load transistor_summary.csv and put in-memory (keep track of the location)
	place transistor_samples.csv in location the server that Viya can access

2) create a new job definition (no prompt) and copy code from transistor_demo.sas to code section. 
	modify line 43 with location of transistor_samples.csv 
	modify line 103, 1112, 113, 115, 116 with location of caslib
	save job as transistor_example
3) Run the job in SAS Studio
	with he transistor_example job open in SAS studio
	click the run button
4) Run the job from web browswer
	get the job link
		Open the job transistor_example in SAS studio
		click on job properties and scroll to "Job Submit" section. 
		copy the URL
	paste the link into a web browser and hit enter
 


Optional - dynamic VA report

1) create VA report
	In Viya go to Explore and Visualize
	create a new report
	add data sources from transistor_summary and capout that was loaded in step 1 above
	add desired data objects such as listbox or scatterplot associated to the capout data source
	save	
2) get the job link
	Open the job "transistor_example"
	click on job properties and scroll to "Job Submit" section. 
	copy the URL
3) back in the VA report
	add a text object
	double click to edit, and then select the hyperlink button
	provide a name and past the URL copied in step 2
	in the options for the entire report, enable the "periodically reload report data" checkox
	set desired update interval
	save
4) click the link and verify the job runs and that the data object updates.
